# ESP32 Connected to HC-SR04 and BME280 Sensors Integrated to Arduino IoT Cloud

* Utilize the provided code, ([ESP32_Thing_Sensors](ESP32_Thing_Sensors)), to connect the ESP32 with HC-SR04 (distance) and BME280 (temperature, humidity, and pressure) sensors for integration with the Arduino IoT Cloud.
* This code is also designed for controlling a red LED.
* Assemble your circuit on a breadboard using the specified components.
* Finally, once the ESP32 is integrated with the Arduino IoT Cloud, you can control the LED and monitor the sensor readings.
