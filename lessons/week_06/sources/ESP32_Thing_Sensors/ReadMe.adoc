= Project: ESP32 Connected to HC-SR04 and BME280 Sensors Integrated to Arduino IoT Cloud

ESP32 connected to HC-SR04 and BME280 sensors, and also a red led, to be integrated to Arduino IoT Cloud.

== Step 1: Arduino IoT Cloud

=== Step 1.1: Create a Esp32 Thing on Arduino IoT Cloud.
=== Step 1.2: Connected the variables to the ESP32 Thing on Arduino IoT Cloud.

== Step 2: Assemble the sensors, the red led and esp32 on a breadboard.

=== BOM
The materials you need for this project.

|===
| ID | Part name        | Quantity
| R1 | Resistor         | 1       
| L1 | Red LED          | 1        
| E1 | ESP32            | 1
| S1 | BME280           | 1
| S2 | HC-SR04          | 1

Assemble the circuit following the diagram layout.png attached to the sketch

== Step 3: Download the files in this project.

=== Folder structure

....
 ESP32_Thing_Sensors                => Arduino sketch folder
  ├── ESP32_Thing_Sensors.ino       => main Arduino file
  ├── thingProperties.h             => thing Properties to connect to Arduino IoT Cloud
  └── ReadMe.adoc                   => this file
....

== Step 4: Run ESP32_Thing_Sensors.ino on Arduino IDE.

== Step 5: Observe the sensor variables and control the red led on Arduino IoT Cloud.
