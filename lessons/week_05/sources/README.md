# ESP32 Integration to Arduino IoT Cloud

* Develop a program that utilizes the ESP32's temperature sensor to monitor local temperature and enables remote LED control.
* Ensure the ESP32 is configured to connect to the internet via WiFi.
* Seamlessly integrate your ESP32 device with the Arduino IoT Cloud.
* Construct a user-friendly interface within the Arduino IoT Cloud that not only displays temperature readings from the ESP32 sensor but also includes a toggle switch for LED control.
* Utilize the provided code snippet ([ESP32_Thing_marc25c](ESP32_Thing_marc25c)) as a starting point for your program. Simply adjust the specified variables within the source code to tailor it to your needs.
